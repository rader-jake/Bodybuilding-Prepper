Great start but the app currently feels empty and bare.
Enhance the product with the following UX and feature improvements, while keeping the existing stack and architecture:
1) Athlete dashboard experience
Create a rich athlete dashboard at /athlete/dashboard that becomes the default landing page for athletes after login.
Features and layout:
Top section (hero card):
Welcome message with athlete’s name and small avatar.
Quick summary: current phase (off‑season / prep / peak week / post‑show), next show name and date if available.
A primary CTA button: “Submit Weekly Check‑In”.
Main content area, in a responsive two‑column layout on desktop and single column on mobile:
Card: “This Week’s Overview”
Show last check‑in date, weight, and a simple trend indicator (e.g., “Down 0.8 kg vs last week”).
Status pill like “On track” or “Needs check‑in”.
Card: “Workout Plan”
Placeholder (for now) that lists the current training split for the week (just static data or a simple text field if no structured schema exists yet).
Button/link: “View full workout plan”.
Card: “Meal Plan”
Similar placeholder card showing current macros or a simple list of meals with macros.
Button/link: “View full meal plan”.
Card: “Coach Notes”
Show the latest coach feedback from the most recent check‑in, or a placeholder message if none exists.
Design notes:
Use a consistent app shell: app bar with logo/name, profile menu, and a sidebar on desktop (see below).
Use the existing color palette and typography.
Use cards with rounded corners and light shadows to make the dashboard feel alive.
2) Navigation & layout (sidebar + mobile)
Introduce a responsive navigation layout:
On desktop:
Left sidebar with navigation items (icons + labels): Dashboard, Check‑In, History, Workout Plan, Meal Plan, Settings/Profile.
The sidebar should be collapsible (icon‑only vs expanded), but it’s okay if that’s a later enhancement.
On mobile:
No fixed sidebar; instead use either:
A top “hamburger” menu that opens a slide‑in drawer with the same nav items, or
A bottom tab bar with key sections: Dashboard, Check‑In, History, Profile.
You can create a shared layout component for athletes (e.g., app/(athlete)/layout.tsx) that renders the sidebar/nav and wraps athlete pages.
3) Workout and meal plan views (stubbed but real UI)
Even if the backend schema for workout plans and meal plans is minimal or not yet fully defined, create initial pages and components:
app/athlete/workout-plan
Show the current week’s split as a simple table or list (Day → Muscle groups → Notes).
If there is no real data yet, read from a simple placeholder structure or mock data with the intention to wire it up later.
Add space for future expansion: sets, reps, RPE, etc.
app/athlete/meal-plan
Show either macros per day (e.g., protein, carbs, fats, calories) and/or a simple list of meals.
Again, this can be based on a simple schema or mocked data for now, but the UI should look finished.
The goal is to make it feel like a real coaching platform, even if some data is still hard‑coded.
4) Photo / camera support for weekly check‑ins
Extend the athlete check‑in flow to support photos:
On the check‑in page, add a dedicated “Check‑In Photos” section.
Allow the athlete to:
Upload one or more photos (e.g., front, side, back) via file input.
On mobile, allow using the device camera where supported (e.g., set accept="image/*" and capture="environment" or similar best practices).
For now, you can store uploaded images in Supabase storage and save their URLs in the check_ins table (extend the schema to handle multiple photos sensibly: either a separate check_in_photos table or a JSON array column like photo_urls).
Add a simple gallery view for photos:
In the check‑in detail view (/athletes/[athleteId]/check-ins/[checkInId] or athlete history), show small thumbnails of the uploaded photos.
Clicking a thumbnail should open a larger preview (modal/lightbox).
5) Profile picture and basic profile settings
Add a profile settings page where both coaches and athletes can manage basic personal details:
Create app/settings/profile or app/(account)/settings/profile.
Fields: display name, optional bio, time zone, and profile picture.
Allow upload of a profile picture:
Store in Supabase storage with a URL reference in the profiles table.
Show the avatar in the app bar / sidebar and on the dashboard hero card.
The UI should include:
Avatar component that shows either the uploaded image or initials if no image exists.
Clean form with clear labels and a primary “Save changes” button.
6) General polish & “not naked” feel
In general, add the following to make the app feel complete:
Skeleton loaders or simple loading states for dashboard and data‑heavy pages.
Empty states for when there is no data yet (e.g., “You don’t have a workout plan yet. Your coach will add one soon.”).
Consistent use of cards, section headings, and spacing across all new pages.
Implementation guidance
Keep using Javascript and the current design system (fonts, colors, button/card styles).
Prefer server components for data loading, but use client components where necessary (forms, camera access, interactions).
Reuse and extend existing components instead of creating completely separate ones where possible.
Clearly label any new files and components you add, and ensure navigation is wired up (links in sidebar/mobile nav).
Start by:
Updating the layout/navigation for the athlete experience.
Implementing the athlete dashboard with the sections described.
Adding the check‑in photo/camera support and profile settings page.
Then we can iterate further on workout/meal plan data and coach‑side UX.
